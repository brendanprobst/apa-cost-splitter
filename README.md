# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About the Project

This is a side project to solve an issue my pool (billiards) team faced - splitting costs each week. The app allows users to save information about their team, including the players, team name, and number.
Each week, you can mark who played the match vs who attended and it will split out the cost of the league dues and the table fees for the night.
There is also an option to add in any additional shared costs.
